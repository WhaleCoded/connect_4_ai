# connect_4_ai

A bot I trained to play Connect 4 and a game to interface with said bot.

The game can be played by running the app.py file inside of the connect_4_game folder.
In order for the game to run, you will need to have PyTorch, Scipy, Numpy, and Flask installed in your python environment.
